> ### **[Demo](https://dev-rodion.github.io/notes-app/)**

<br>

I was inspired this **[YouTube Lesson](https://youtu.be/ulOKYl5sHGk)**, but have made it much better. 

To give the ability to edit and style the text, I added **[jodit-react](https://github.com/jodit/jodit-react)**.<br>
To save notes after leaving or reloading the page, the application stores the data in **localStorage**.<br>
For the convenience of using Notes App, the application is **adapted for mobile devices**.

In future I want to:

* Add animations
* Port this project to TypeScript <br>
