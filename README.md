# Notes App

<br>

![Intro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71597887/158647960-0288e5d9-a079-4841-8445-a1b590d7428c.PNG)

I was inspired this **[YouTube Lesson](https://youtu.be/ulOKYl5sHGk)**, but have made it much better. 

To give the ability to edit and style the text, I added **[React Quil](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-quill)**.<br>
To save notes after leaving or reloading the page, the application stores the data in **localStorage**.<br>
For the convenience of using Notes App, the application is **adapted for mobile devices**.

I want to port my project to TypeScript <br>
Also I want to add animations.
